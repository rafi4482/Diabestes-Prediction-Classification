## Project Overview

![Diabetes](images/diabetes.jpg)

The project uses machine learning algorithms to predict diabetes based on a dataset of health-related features. We explore the data, preprocess it, build predictive models, and evaluate their performance.

The frameworks/libraries used in this project:

- Python 3.11
- Libraries: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, scikit-learn

## Dataset

![Dataset](images/data.png)

The dataset used for this project contains health-related features, including age, BMI, and glucose levels. It's available in the data directory.

## Exploratory Data Analysis

We perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to gain insights into the dataset, visualize feature distributions, and identify correlations.
